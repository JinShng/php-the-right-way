# PHP: The Right Way

## What?

There's a lot of bad information on the Web (I'm looking at you, W3Schools) that leads new PHP users astray, propagating bad practices and bad code. This must stop. _PHP: The Right Way_ provides an easy-to-read, quick reference for PHP best practices, accepted coding standards, and links to authoritative tutorials around the Web.

## How to Contribute

_PHP: The Right Way_ is hosted on GitHub Pages. It is a Jekyll project available in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/codeguy/php-the-right-way/tree/gh-pages) branch. Fork and edit the [gh-pages](https://github.com/codeguy/php-the-right-way/tree/gh-pages) branch, add some examples or helpful links, and send me a pull request. Let's make this the best resource available for new PHP programmers!

### Translations

If you are interested in translating _PHP: The Right Way_, fork this repo on GitHub and publish your localized fork to your own GitHub Pages account. We'll link to your translation from the primary document.

To avoid fragmentation and reader confusion, please choose one of these options:

1. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with `[username].github.com/php-the-right-way`
2. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with a subdomain (e.g. "ru.phptherightway.com")

If you use a subdomain, enter the subdomain into the `CNAME` file, and ask us to setup DNS for you. If you do not use a subdomain, remove the `CNAME` file entirely else your fork will not build when pushed.

When your translation is ready, open an issue on the Issue Tracker to let us know.
